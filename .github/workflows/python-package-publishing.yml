# This is a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the package and publishes it to the PyPI, the Python Package Index.
# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a variety of Python versions
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
